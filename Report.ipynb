    "Book crossing is a website that enables free sharing of books, either with friends or with complete strangers by wild-releasing books in public places. They offer optional paid membership for new members that includes features like book recommendation. These recommendations direct to the  Better World Books website which is an online book-selling portal.  \n",

    "In this context, better top-k recommendations generate revenue to Bookcrossing in two ways:  \n",

    "1. Better recommendations translate to purchases at World Books and Bookcrossings gets a share.  \n",

    "2. Personalized recommendations leads to user satisfaction resulting in retention of users and brand value. This contributes to revenue through paid memberships as new users would opt for the optional membership and existing users would continue to pay to retain the membership.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our business objective is to generate k recommendations(top-k recommendation) for users logged into bookcrossings website."

    "### Accuracy\n",
    "Since our objective is to recommend $k$ items to the user, evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE which measure accuracy of rating prediction are not very indicative of the end-user experience. To satisfy our business objective, we are are more concerned about the precision at the top. Hence we choose the following evaluation metrics:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**:   \n",
    "    Precision measures the proportion of recommended items that are actually relevant and is directly related to our business objective. We define an item as being relevant to a user, if he gave it a rating of 7 or above. We empirically chose the threshold value to be 7 based on the ratings distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall**:   \n",
    "    Recall indicates the proportion of relevant items that are in the recommended list. We consider recall also because it provides information on the expected performance of the recommender system regarding the unknown complete data (i.e., all books), which exactly is what is experienced by the user. If we assume that relevant ratings are missing at random (while allowing all other rating values to be missing not at random), then Recall can be estimated without bias from observed MNAR data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **F-score**:   \n",
    "    F-score summarizes the trade-off between precision and recall.  \n",

    "    In our case, the ranking between 1st and 2nd ranked books is more important than those at the end of the list. Moreover, unlike in precision and recall, NCDG does not require relevance to be binary, allowing the user’s preference of the book to expressed in multiple levels of relevance. In order to incorporate these idea, we use the normalized discounted cumulative gain to evaluation our recommendation lists.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Other variations of the kNN model were tried to check if they could improve our evaluation metrics. The kNN model with mean offset was tried to correct possible offsets in the mean ratings by individual users or on individual items. The kNN model with Z-score correction was used to correct for the mean and standard deviation of the ratings. These variations did not give any improvements, and the basic kNN model was found to work best with respect to the evaluation metrics we want to optimize for.  \n",

The rationale is that certain users might not be very critical and tend to rate all books highly, or certain books may tend to always have low ratings. We also include a global bias term. These biases are learnt by the model. So for this model, the prediction $\\hat{r}_{ui}$ is set as:  \n",

    "From the above table, we observe that all the models perform better than the random predictions model that we used as  a baseline. Moreover, Matrix factorization using SVD performs consistently better than the kNN model. Given the extreme sparsity of the data set, these results makes sense. Memory based methods like kNN overfit to the sparse data we have, and do not generalize at all. SVD, on the other hand, overcomes this problem by introducing the regularization term in the objective function. It is also helpful to remember that we found the regularization parameter ($\\lambda$) of value 1 to be optimum. This relatively higher value of $\\lambda$ is also indicative of the high sparsity in the data."

    "The first figure above illustrates how F-score varies as the sample size increases. We observe that performance of both k-NN and svd models as measured by the F-score metric decreases as sample size increases. This could be attributed to the fact that the subsampling inevitably makes the sample denser. Because the way we clean data somehow will filter out more active users(i.e., users that rated lots of books). So if we randomly sample the data, those active users may still satisfy our filtering condition(i.e., rated at least 20 books), but those less active users are more likely to be cleaned. Hense as the sample size becomes smaller, the proportion of active user becomes larger, thus more dense. The takeaway from this section is that SVD Matrix factorization models perform better than memory based models as the ratings matrix becomes sparser.  \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The biggest challenge in generating top-10 recommendations using the bookcrossing dataset is the extreme sparsity. SVD performs reasonably well both in terms of accuracy and coverage at top-k. Its running time and accuracy also scales well with the sample size in comparison to memory based methods. Another MF technique that can also be explored is the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization technique due to the non-negative nature of the ratings, especially for the greater interpretability. Moreover, online evaluation metrics like click-through rate should be used to evaluate to actual efficacy of the recommender system in terms of achieving the business objective.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we limit ourselves to collaborative filtering methods. However the information about the books can be easily obtained using the ISBN number of the book, to overcome the cold start problem when the new user becomes a member, or when a new book is released. A hybrid of content based and collaborative filtering methods can be used to generate more relevant recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the recommendations to translate to purchases or higher user satisfaction, we need to evaluate our recommender system in terms of how diverse and serendipitous the recommendations are. Also, since bookcrossing provides information about location of the user, this information can be used to notify the user of book tours near his location. This would help improve the effectiveness of the wild releases that Book-crossings already conducts in public spaces."
